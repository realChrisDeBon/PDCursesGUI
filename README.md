# PDCursesGUI
A starter template for making some basic GUI elements in PDCurses.

This is a very preliminary sample program I've put together that implements features in PDCurses to create basic GUI elements.
Some of the basic elements are working near perfect. The textbox still has some glitchy behavior with the scrolling I'm working on and 
the button click event needs some closer examination. At some point once all the kinks are worked out, I'll likely refactor this into 
.DLL  class library for portability. Feel free to use this for your own projects.
